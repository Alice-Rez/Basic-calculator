# Basic Calculator

## Description

Small project that was done during my web development course just after 9 days of learning Javascript.

- Calculator has basic mathematic operations and modulo (placed at _%_ key)
- User can just once add decimal point.
- Sign of the number can be changed anytime during inserting of the numbers
- After getting result using _=_ key, user can continue in calculation using another operation key or start new calculation by typing number
- User can also continue calculation without using _=_ key just by clicking on the one of the operation keys
- All calculation can be also restarted using by _A/C_ key
- If the result of the operations has more characters that is possible to get at display, it will be displayed with scientific notation
